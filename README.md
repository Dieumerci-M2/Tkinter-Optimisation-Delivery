# Tkinter-Optimisation-Delivery

It is a project in artificial intelligence that consists in placing a point of sale or a store in a city and then placing the delivery routes. The algorithm I implemented will help you to find the shortest way for all your deliveries without wasting much energy. 

# How can i run it?

* Firstly this code can't run if you use Python2 version.. Try to update your Python2 version to Python3 or greather than the latter if is exist.
Try this code to upgrade your python version : 

        - sudo apt-get update
        - sudo apt-secure update
        - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
        - sudo apt install python3-pip
        - python3 --version
        - sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.<your current version> 1

* If you use Python3 version try to install all this packages and dependancies, open your Terminal and go to your clone folder, (on my part i used Linux OS if you use another OS try to search how you can install the following key-word ) :

        - sudo apt-get -y install python3-tk
        - pip3 install customtkinter
        - pip3 install tkintermapview
        - sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk 
        - pip install pandas
        
* If you the name of the file .py you can get this code to run the project : 

        - python3 map_with_customtkinter3.py
